# This is a wrapper script for running `ipole` on the Open Science
# Grid with HTCondor.  Note that `ipole` accept more options via a
# paramter file, compare to command line arguments.  Hence, this
# wrapper takes command line arguments, turn them into a `ipole`
# parameter file "ipole.par" through a template, and then run
# `ipole -par ipole.par` to fully configure `ipole`.
